                  Presiding: D. LUD. CAPPELLO.
                  
                  Respondent: DANIEL BOURGET, of Normandy and Crocy.
                  
                  Since in the preceding disputations it has been shown that to the human race there has been given by God Christ the Redeemer, to be embraced by faith by each individual unto salvation, and that this faith is not from us but from God, whose gift it is singularly, and since therefore both from experience itself and from the testimony of Scripture it follows that faith is not of all, that is, that not all believe, and consequently that by God there has been made a certain distinction and separation among men, to whom He has given faith to some but has denied it to others, this sort of secrecy is what is commonly called Election and Reprobation, of which we are now to speak according to the established order. Of this disputation we have made two parts, the former κατασκευαστική, in which what that thing is, which is called Election, will be explained; the latter ἀνασκευαστική, in which whatever is objected against it or errors that are raised will be more fully demonstrated. But that the whole matter, whatever it is, may be set forth more clearly, we shall briefly repeat the thing itself with a slightly different statement.
                  
                  
                  THESIS PRIMA.
                  
                  It is certain among all those who are not utterly atheistic and profane, and who believe the soul of man to be immortal, that happiness is not to be concluded within the narrow bounds of this mortal life, but is rather to be placed in that life which follows, and for which the brevity and calamity of the present life prepares us and bids us to expect. Even the pagans acknowledged this, who believed their heroes to be admitted into heaven after this life, and other men of a lower order, yet upright and lovers of virtue, to enjoy perpetual happiness in the Elysian fields.
                  
                  II. Nor is it less certain that that perpetual happiness is not promised to all, but is granted only to a few; for the same pagans consigned others, far more numerous, to eternal torments in the infernal regions.
                  
                  III. If you ask from them the cause of such diverse lot and condition, they will assign no other than the diverse life-conduct of these and of those; some of them, namely, had lived well, justly, and holily, and were earnest in the pursuit of virtue; others were evil and impious. And thus far indeed they judged rightly.
                  
                  IV. But if you further ask whence it is that some here are good and pious, while others are evil and wicked, scarcely any of even their wisest philosophers answered otherwise than that it was in their own power and free choice what life each one wished to pursue; that man is free by free will [liberum arbitrium] to direct his life to good or to evil, and that the ability is in himself by nature to incline either to good or to evil.
                  
                  V. But that man himself should be the arbiter and architect of his own happiness, as though he had set it for himself, and that it should not be owed to the gift and beneficence of God, is plainly contrary to right reason, since God is altogether the author, cause, and fountain of all good things, as even the wiser and more sober pagans acknowledged.
                  
                  VI. Far otherwise than those pagans and certain philosophers does Christian piety and religion teach, and divine revelation—which (just as that, so also this, as experience sufficiently proves, blinded and made foolish by its own ἐννοίαι [notions], was not well consulted)—does not teach that man, from his boyhood and infancy merely, but even from the very womb and from birth, is corrupt, prone not to virtue but to vice, that is, inclined toward evil by a human rather than a divine nature, and indeed by a greatly laborious training, and by divine help and grace assisting, cannot of itself rise up to any true zeal for virtue. And some of them, although very few (especially as we hear in Plato), acknowledged this, that virtue was not μάθησις [learning] but a certain divine gift to mortals (as the wiser of them loved to say) whom the gods willed to bless with benevolence and gifts.
                  
                  VII. Nor only this, that no one, however just he may seem to be, can live free from vice and crime, and pure from any stain, and that for this reason before the most just and most severe God he stands guilty of sin, condemned and exposed to punishment, and that he would scarcely escape anything except by sincere and true repentance; but also that without this satisfaction due to God, no reconciliation unto salvation would be made, unless God Himself should show and provide a sufficient mode of satisfying. Since man is wholly by nature ignorant of the mode of satisfying, and since it is completely impossible for him, it is necessary that God teach us this way and satisfy for us Himself.
                  
                  VIII. God, who gave Christ unto death for this reason of satisfying divine justice, revealed this in the Gospel to men, and through the preaching of it proposes to all men everywhere, although not to individuals, to be embraced. He sent the Apostles throughout the whole world, and the Evangelists who succeeded them everywhere as heralds, who should proclaim the glad message, and by emerging from it (in which of their own accord they are precipitated by their own vice) should open to men the way of escaping eternal misery, and by proposing the true mode of embracing it, should invite men to sincere repentance by their exhortations.
                  
                  IX.
                  
                  But not all are so compliant toward this kindly invitation and the divine message as to receive it with a well-disposed mind. For many formerly rejected Christ offered for the salvation and redemption of the world, and today despise Him. For even to this day the Jews, blinded by their obstinate unbelief, reject Him; and the nations, given over for some ages now to idolatry and wretched superstition, have rejected Christ, and today now for many ages have been persuaded and deceived by the most false imposture of Muhammad and the Turks. Those also who profess the Christian faith are Heretics, who, although they differ only by errors that are capable of being cured, yet because they deny that Christ is of the same nature, person, offices, gifts, passions, and benefits, and orthodox with the Catholic truth, depart far from it; and by these very errors they have separated themselves from the unity of the Church. Finally, there are among Christians very many who, although they hold rightly concerning the nature of Christ, His person, offices, gifts, passions, and benefits, nevertheless, by their lasciviousness and license of life, and by the baseness and shame of their conduct, make manifest that they have not yet embraced the true faith of Christ, since they cling to sin and evil deeds.
                  
                  X. Indeed, even among Orthodox Christians themselves who profess the saving doctrine of Christ, not all have that true and through-charity operational faith in Christ (such as the Gospel demands), but have it only in an external confession and not in the inner recesses of the heart, content with a merely theoretical knowledge. If they wish to be saved, it is necessary that they seriously repent; indulging their own corruption of sin and native depravity, they scarcely even begin to be pious, and they approve of themselves and of others as good by their works and by a praiseworthy life, and yet prove themselves to be faithful only by serious repentance.
                  
                  XI. That distinction which we observe among men in life and morals, in faith, doctrine, and religion, must necessarily be something other than itself. Whence, therefore, must we assign the first origin of that difference? To the nature of man? To Aristotle (one must excuse the phrase) and to the first ignorance, that is, from infancy? But nature is corrupt, and conceived in sin.
                  
                  XII. “Who will give a clean thing from an unclean?” says Job, Job 14:4. Or who from evil will expect what is good? Or, says Christ, “Do they gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles? A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor an evil tree good fruit” (Matthew 7:17–18). Especially since with that native spot and vice of origin, in which we are all conceived, unless something be added from elsewhere, in all respects and equally it is necessary. Whence therefore comes that difference in man (by which one is made better than another) than that the one be cured, purified, and amended from that innate vice?
                  
                  XIII. But who else can grant this except God, the author and most true fountain of all good, both physical (that is, natural) good and moral good, and of the hyperphysical and divine good (such as true virtue and Christian piety and religion)? He alone can tear out the malignity of our nature, extinguish the power of evil lusts, and by the efficacy of the Spirit accomplish it. And this in a manner and rational order agreeable to nature’s understanding, namely through doctrine and instruction by the preaching of the word; to which, the efficacy of the Spirit accompanying it in some, He infuses faith into human hearts, and by that same faith sanctifies their hearts. “For by faith their hearts are purified” (Acts 10:9).
                  
                  XIV. In infants, however—who also pertain to the kingdom of heaven, and who cannot yet by age either understand or perceive the Gospel—this is not known to us but is known with certainty to God, who is able to grant the same thing necessarily, since nothing unclean can enter the kingdom of heaven, nor without true sanctification can one behold God, in whose vision alone consists the true and eternal blessedness of man (Luke 18:16; Ephesians 5; Hebrews 12:14).
                  
                  XV. And it must indeed be said that He who changes the whole man into good is the same God, who, as Scripture teaches everywhere, demonstrates His love toward men, and, as has been proved in the preceding theses on the Nature of God, is the author of every good.
                  
                  XVI. Since therefore from God alone is that true Faith and Sanctification, and it is clear that it is not of all, but only of few, and is the gift of God, it is manifest that a certain discrimination, whereby some come between others and are preferred by God—who, although distributing His gift freely, yet does not deny it to anyone—comes from the free counsel and gift of God, who at His free choice dispenses it to whom He wills, and by that same free choice denies it to whom He wills (cf. 2 Thessalonians 2; Ephesians 2).
                  
                  XVII. That most free gift of faith and repentance, and through faith of true sanctification, which is given by God to men, is indeed a dispensation, not from some external and temporal decree of God, but from His eternal decree and counsel; for since God acts in time, it is certain that what He has decreed with definite counsel He determined to bring about in time. For since He is wise, He neither takes counsel in time nor acts as in uncertainty or with imagination and deliberated counsel, as if in suspense.
                  
                  XVIII. This decree of God is from a certain election, by which He does not at some time communicate His grace to all, nor did He decree to communicate it to all, but in a certain fixed manner, it is necessary that He chose some from others to whom He would communicate that gift and benefit of faith; whence also that which is called the Faith of the Elect of God (Titus 1:1), because it is of those whom He chose.
                  
                  XIX. And from this it necessarily follows that those to whom that benefit is not communicated are passed over in that communication, and are passed over by a certain counsel. Those whom He passed over, to these He is not obligated to give Grace, nor is He unjust if He repels them; but if He does not repel, then He hands them over no more than others to their own counsel.
                  
                  XX. And since God thus communicates His grace to some so that He approves them, loves them, regards them with favor, consequently those to whom He does not grant the same grace, either because He denies it or because He judges them unworthy of it, He reproves them and has them as odious.
                  
                  XXI. This is that decree of Election and Reprobation, whether eternal or from some mass of men, corrupt and needing to be chosen or reproved, which God has among Himself, either to communicate salvation to some from that mass, or not to communicate it to others; of which the Apostle clearly speaks in Romans 9, where he sets before us that decree under the type of Jacob and Esau, of whom it was said by God, “The elder shall serve the younger,” and “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated” (Genesis 25:23; Malachi 1:2–3).
                  
                  XXII. This decree stands in the very benevolence, freedom, and most free will of God, as the Apostle there teaches from the words of God to Moses: “I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,” that is, “On whom I will have pity, I will pity,” and consequently, “He is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy.” And he soon concludes, verse 18: “Therefore he has mercy on whom he wills, and whom he wills he hardens.” Those whom He thus passes over in the communication of His grace, He does not soften their hearts by that grace; therefore they remain hard, and the more they are left to themselves, the more they are strengthened in malice; but those on the contrary whose hearts God touches with His grace, He softens them, and converts them to true repentance and to God.
                  
                  XXIII. These are those vessels of which the Apostle speaks in the same place, verses 22 and 23, some indeed which have been prepared unto glory, others unto ἀπωλεία [destruction], others unto ἐκκεγχύσθαι εἰς ἀτιμίαν [to be poured out unto dishonor], and indeed according to the pleasure of God and His most free power, which God has not otherwise than as a potter has the power from the same mass to make one vessel for honor and another for dishonor (verse 21).
                  
                  XXIV. Who then will deny this power to God, which Christ Himself attributes to Him (Matthew 20:16), that He may extend His grace to whom He wills, and according to His most free will may grant it, and to whom He wills may deny it, when He is debtor to none, and when from men He demands no reason for His will? And who will vindicate a right from God, as if any injury were done to someone?
                  
                  XXV. Therefore no one can complain here of any injustice of God’s freedom which is natural to Him; nor can it be said that He, without any distinction, draws one man to salvation and rejects another. For this is called the denial of an undeserved benefit, which is far removed from any fraudulent injury, much more from injustice, of which there is absolutely none. God is not bound to any man to bestow a benefit (if it is not freely given), nor is it repugnant to any meaning of His mind or will that He repels the obstinate from saving grace or concedes it to those who are converted.
                  
                  XXVI. Wherefore that which pertains to God (who offers multiple arguments and convictions to men seeking the grace of conversion, or ἀναστροφῆς [turning], sufficient for those not refusing themselves) is to teach those who ought to accept the grace offered; but that some accepted and some did not accept, nor even would accept because of a hard and impenitent heart, is to be imputed to them. Such are those to whom it is said, “He who received the seed on the good ground… but those among the thorns and stones… but he who received the seed on the good soil, this is he who hears Christ” (Matthew 13:19).
                  
                  XXVII. This election freely made by God of a few out of the mass of men, first to the grace of faith and true sanctification, then indeed afterwards to glory and eternal life, is established by Scripture. “For whom He foreknew, them He also called; and whom He called, them He also justified; and whom He justified, them He also glorified” (Romans 8:30). And indeed this calling is certain and infallible, and in all things they are more than conquerors, “through Him who loved us,” and gave His life for us in Christ, nor can angels, nor any creature whatsoever, ever separate us from Him (Romans 8:37–38). “No one is able to pluck My sheep out of the hand of Christ the Son; for all things the Father gives are greater” (John 10:29).
                  
                  XXVIII. But those whom He wills to save, He first effectually calls, whether to true faith, or inserts them into Christ, then makes them believers; because of Christ’s merit and satisfied righteousness, He justifies them, that is, absolves them from sins, through the Spirit whom Christ has deservedly obtained for them from the Father, sanctifies them, and finally after death grants them eternal life and receives them into heaven.
                  
                  XXIX. Therefore the decree of giving faith is, properly speaking, the decree of election, for by the gift of faith men are distinguished from others; and this gift equally corrals and joins them together as more miserable by the first as by the second and quasi-hidden choice. For what else is it in this matter to choose than truly and actually to separate those to whom you prefer to grant benefits, and by a kind of intention and as if by an eye, to designate and mark out those to whom you wish to do good?
                  
                  XXX. This decree of giving faith is not first in time (all things in God’s decrees are simultaneous by the eternal order), but in the thing itself it is prior to the decree of justifying and sanctifying, and thus also to the decree of glorifying the one who believes; and from these it must be distinguished. For to believe is one thing, to be justified is another, to be sanctified is another, to be glorified is another. If it were otherwise, the decree of God by which He determined to give faith to man would be the same as that by which He determined to justify, sanctify, and finally glorify the one determined for His purpose.
                  
                  XXXI. Neither is the decree of glorifying the first separation among men, but the decree of giving faith; for those who truly believe, and actually, are first separated from unbelievers, who although equal before had been. Nor did God first decree absolutely to glorify a man, then afterward to give him faith; but on the contrary, He decreed first to give faith, then to glorify. For just as no one can be glorified without believing, so He did not decree to glorify without mercy.
                  
                  XXXII. Therefore, if any order of the decrees of God is to be constituted, it must not be from God Himself, but from our perspective and from our way of conceiving and considering things, established according to the order most fitting to us (for in God Himself all things are decreed at once, and the same will of His simple and highest essence). It seems to us therefore that, first of all, God, from His Wisdom, then from His Goodness, then from His Justice, decreed to create the world and man in it, to whom He might communicate His goodness, and thereby to demonstrate His Power, Goodness, and Wisdom.
                  
                  XXXIII. Then, that man created and placed in a natural state of mutable liberty, He should permit to fall—or that he should not slip, or that he should be hindered from falling—from which He shows that He is Lord and Master, by the exercise of His free liberty, which is bound to no one. Third, that man fallen into sin and brought under the dominion and power of the Devil, He should deliver from eternal misery, which is the most miserable death; that is, that He should rescue him from that misery (which God showed to be His most eminent mercy) if by no means His justice violated by sin would allow man to be freed without a sufficient satisfaction.
                  
                  XXXIV. Fourth, since neither we ourselves, nor anyone from us—even if he willed to satisfy for us—could satisfy, He decreed to send Christ, who for all men promiscuously of sinners, provided they would believe and repent, would satisfy. And finally, since no one already was able to believe (because of innate corruption and the perversity of his nature), He decreed to give faith to some, to whom He willed; decreed to give that Spirit by whom Christ was inserted; decreed that those believing by the application of Christ’s merit, by the benefit of His satisfaction, should enjoy absolution from all sins and should consequently have true sanctification and eternal glorification.
                  
                  XXXV. But the cause of this election and of its object, namely man himself fallen and miserable, and the cause of this effecting, is the grace, favor, and beneficent will of God toward us undeserving; the meritorious cause is the merit of Christ. Concerning Reprobation, which must be distinguished from Election, the first thing is that Damnation itself precedes Reprobation, and is both the cause and the object of Reprobation.
                  
                  XXXVI. Therefore Damnation itself is one thing, Reprobation another, and also the decree of Damnation is one thing, and the decree and cause of Reprobation another. Damnation is the just and deserved penalty of sins. Reprobation is the denial of grace, that is, the denial of divine help necessary for faith and true and sincere repentance. Damnation is the cause of Reprobation, simply because of sins, namely unbelief and final impenitence, which precede Reprobation. But it is not therefore to be said that God reprobates a man unless first he is damned by his own sins; and when therefore anyone lies in invincible unbelief and impenitence, he is damned by God, that is, condemned; and if he does not want to turn, he is rightly said to be reprobated.
                  
                  XXXVII. Reprobation can be considered in two ways: either absolutely and in itself, or comparatively. Reprobation, if considered in itself and absolutely, has sin as its cause; that is, man as sinner deserves to be reprobated by God, whether worthy of it—as when God rejects, if He wills, His grace and the gift of His goodness—from one undeserving, and to whom God grants only the benefit of justice—or unworthy, and to whom God grants the benefit of His goodness. No one, however (as has been said), is reprobated by God except for sin; unless He sees him lying in sin and corrupt, and has foreseen him from eternity. For no one can complain justly if grace is excluded from him, that is, a benefit undeserved, of which one deserving of condemnation is unworthy. For God owes nothing to man guilty of sin; nor is God bound to him unless He wills.
                  
                  XXXVIII. Reprobation considered comparatively is this: that God more willingly grants His grace to some, and therefore, more willingly denies it to others. The cause of this comparative reprobation is the same perfection of God’s goodness, namely that He wills as He wills. For if all are sinners, and from this cause, all equally by nature are worthy of punishment, all equally deserve to be reprobated. That the reprobation of this decree be thus considered, no other cause is able to be given except the same good pleasure of God, namely that God from eternity decreed more willingly to deny that gift of faith and repentance to certain sinners, and more willingly to grant it to others more undeserving than those whom He denies. Nor is this anything else except that He wills so because He wills. For if His will is free to do what He wills, why is it not lawful for Him to grant His grace to one, and deny it to another?
                  
                  XXXIX. From this it follows that Reprobation is no less a cause than Election is a cause of mercy, as the Apostle asserts when he compares men to the potter’s clay (Romans 9:18). For to whom He wills, He has mercy, and whom He wills, He hardens; yet man receives one and the other equally. “Who are you, O man, who answers back to God? Shall the thing formed say to Him who formed it, Why have you made me thus? Has not the potter power over the clay, from the same mass to make one vessel for honor, and another for dishonor?”
                  
                  XL. Indeed, the Apostle was ready to answer here: “It is fitting that God reject, and exclude from grace, a sinner and wicked man,” but for this cause of reprobation considered in itself absolutely—that is, the cause sought why God excludes His grace from one, and grants it to another—he could not give the reason; but for that reason the objection could be made in this way: “He who is excluded no less than he who is a sinner, why therefore is he not excluded equally?” Hence there is recourse to the good pleasure of God, as to the supreme cause, beyond which no other is noted for us. And from here that cry of the Apostle: “O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out” (Romans 11:33).
                  
                  XLI. For God has His own causes and reasons of this choice known to Himself, but not opened to us; He wills that we acquiesce solely in His good pleasure, for He alone knows what He wills, and to whom He wills to grant anything of His right He can do so, as He has it in Himself; but for the grace of God to be granted, the cause and reason are unknown to us. Prosper, Epistle to Rufinus on Free Will: “Among the hidden judgments… man is not excluded by the divine equity.” And elsewhere: “And God is just when He excludes whom He wills.” And the same Prosper: “Although the cause of God’s judgments be hidden, and the reason not manifest, yet God is not without equity.”
                  
                  XLII. Nor is there any choice with God of προσωποληψία [partiality], much less is there in Him any injustice, who gives to several beggars more than to others in the distribution of His alms, when He is bound to give nothing except what He wills, and it is lawful for Him to do with His own what He wills.
                  
                  XLIII. Moreover, the denial of faith indeed is followed by unbelief and even final impenitence, and from this destruction follows; nevertheless the cause of destruction is just, because that sin—both original, which in the reprobated man is presupposed and foreknown by God, and actual sin, which cannot be avoided by the corrupt man, and is thus necessary—yet is spontaneous and voluntary, not coerced, nor from any physical inability or defect or lack of the natural faculties of understanding and willing, but from an unusual vice and unconquered malice. And this makes him more obstinate and more unjust, and altogether inexcusable and damnable; just as if a son of lost and depraved disposition should say that he cannot from his heart bring himself to love his parents, honor them, cultivate them, or obey them, it would be impossible for him not to have them in hatred—who would not punish and condemn such a monster of a man deservedly?
                  
                  XLIV. These things laid down from the Word of God, the orthodox doctrine of grace and of the divine decree concerning Election, and of the other concerning Reprobation, is consistent with our reason and with the sense of piety; not only not adverse to them, but greatly consonant with them. As even Bellarmine himself, although a very keen defender of free will and the greatest assertor of human merit, acknowledges and proves. For he, in his book on Election, book 2, On Grace, and book On Free Will, chapter 20, writes that Scripture teaches that God chose some out of the whole human race, and decreed these chosen to the kingdom of heaven and eternal salvation; that they should infallibly and unchangeably come thither, and that in the meantime God granted to these salvation and grace, without foresight of all works, and that afterward by parts he proves this from testimonies of Scripture. And concerning Reprobation he contends easily the same in chapter 16. For he says that Augustine (whom he also calls the author of predestination) comprehends two acts of predestination, one to grace, the other to glory; and soon: the first act has no respect to the will and merits of man, but follows the good pleasure of God. And that the second act follows from the foreknowledge of merits, since a certain grace is given beforehand; but from the part of man, since those predestinated, afterwards are given grace by the foreknowledge of sin, and indeed either of original or actual sin.
                  
                  XLV. And this opinion, not only Augustine’s, Prosper’s, Fulgentius’, Gregory’s, Anselm’s, Bede’s, Primasius’, Sedulius’, Bernard’s, and others, but also Augustine himself, Prosper, and Fulgentius clearly show to be the sense of the ancient Fathers. The Church of Christ has never borne the Pelagian persuasion; the Catholics can never deny it. And it is of no weight to object that Augustine himself in some passages seems to contradict himself, or that he everywhere attributes to the divine mercy the conversion and the number of those whom God in Christ from the whole world chose to belong to His kingdom. Augustine, book On the Good of Perseverance, chapter 18; book 2, chapter 23; Prosper in the Response to the Objections of the Gauls; Id. in the Epistle to Rufinus; book On the Incarnation and Grace of Christ, chapter 6, etc.

                  Additions
                  
                  To Thesis 34, line 4, after the word satisfaceret, the following Theses are to be inserted for greater clarity.
                  
                  XXXV. Hitherto there has been as yet no real distinction among men, for two
                  
                  Part II.
                  
                  preceding acts of the divine will, because by condition all men are regarded equally, nor do they regard one more than another. Therefore if God had established nothing else, and had constituted no other act, no one would have been saved, because no one believed.
                  
                  Therefore here there is to be conceived an intervening act of the divine will, more ample (than the two preceding) and conditional, indeed plainly absolute, by which He decreed to bestow certain singular things upon individual men—Peter, for instance, James, John, and the rest—to rescue them from the misery in which by nature they lie, to give salvation by calling, justifying, sanctifying, and glorifying.
                  
                  XXXVI. This is by the Decree of giving faith, which is the first beginning of salvation at any moment, for by it we are justified and ingrafted into Christ, and are members of Him; by that same faith we are sanctified, and at last glorified.
                  
                  XXXVII. This is promised to all προκεκλημένοις [those whom He has forecalled], that is, to those predestined, whom God from eternity has foreknown and, as it were, designated by His most free good pleasure; whom the Apostle also calls κατὰ πρόθεσιν [according to purpose]. These are called by faith’s true calling; and by that same faith they are brought to God, of whom it is said, “whom He called, those also He justified; whom He justified, those He glorified.”
                  
                  XXXVIII. That faith has its cause, as faith itself is to be considered in a twofold way. For in one manner it receives, and applies to itself the merit of the satisfaction of Christ; in another manner it begins the sanctification of our life. In both manner and respect, faith is the first moment and beginning of that salvation of ours which begins in this life.
                  
                  XXXIX. But when these parts of salvation, and the benefits, are compared among themselves, faith is considered with respect to the conditional promises; salvation itself, since it is the effect of justification by faith, is considered with respect to the promises that are absolute; and glorification with respect to sanctification, and sanctification with respect to the efficacy and grace of God, which is necessary. 
                  
                  (Acts 15:9.)
                  
                  XL. And since the parts of our salvation are thus distinguished among themselves, the decree of giving faith must be considered as prior to the decree of justifying, according to that word of the Apostle, “whom He called (that is, effectively, κατὰ πρόθεσιν [according to purpose] unto the giving of faith) those He also justified; and whom He justified, those also He glorified” (Romans 8:30).
                  
                  XLI. Hence it is clear that the Decree of giving Faith (by which the first distinction among men is made, as far as they are all alike, since the same misery envelops all, and the same salvation regards all under the same condition of faith and repentance) is the same decree with the decree of Election; whether it concerns saving certain individual men: because faith is the first moment of their salvation; nor do these two decrees seem so much to be the same as to be considered in different ways.
                  
                  XLII. Because therefore no one had believed: etc. and see above, Thesis 34.

                  THESIS PRIMA.
                  
                  Since, in the preceding Disputation, what Election and Reprobation is has been treated, we must now see what it is not; that is, we must examine the opinions of those who do not seem to explain that matter sufficiently and fittingly. Namely, some so assign the object of it that what ought to be constituted cannot be constituted; others do not establish its legitimate cause; others finally deny Election and Reprobation of certain individual men, and reduce it entirely to a middle condition.
                  
                  II. And let us begin from the beginning. The Socians, and those Disciples and followers of theirs, by no means acknowledge any certain and individual Election and Reprobation of men from God from eternity—neither of individuals nor of the number of them—nor any foreknowledge, foreordination, foreappointment, nor any predesignation, nor any fixed and infallible foresight of the condition under which men are to be saved or damned; namely, faith, repentance, and obedience in the saved, and unbelief and final impenitence in the damned.
                  
                  III. But it is truly certain that God will not save any except the one believing and truly repentant, nor glorify any except the one justified; nor damn any unbelieving and impenitent man, nor absolve any except the one justified, sanctified, and glorified, since He considers faith and unbelief as such. Yet we deny that Scripture signifies to us only this concerning Election and Reprobation; for it moreover teaches that God decreed to save certain individual men—Peter, for instance, James, John, those whom God from eternity decreed to save—and others whom likewise He decreed from eternity to damn.
                  
                  IV. For though they deny that God denies faith to anyone because of unbelief, disobedience, or impenitence before the act itself exists, yet they hasten too quickly and infallibly to foresee and proclaim that very act or that impenitent and wicked man; much less to foresee and predesignate beforehand. Nor does the impious and blasphemous man obstinately persist in the hatred of God except because of the divine foresight of the future act; which would cease to be future, or contingent, or accidental, if it had been predesignated beforehand, and certainly and infallibly foreknown; for then no one, unless impious and profane, would dare to affirm that God decreed to hate a man before he existed, and before he had been foreknown or predesigned by God.
                  
                  V. Moreover, it is certain and definite that the number of certain individual elect persons from God, known to Him from eternity, is sufficiently indicated by Scripture, when it says: “Rejoice, because your names are written in heaven, in the book of life” (Luke 10:20; Philippians 4:3). “Whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb from the foundation of the world” (Apocalypse 13:8; 17:8). Likewise when it says, “The Lord knows those who are His” (2 Timothy 2:19). For those things cannot be said accidentally (as the Socinians want), nor of some general class of men, but of certain men individually named and of singular persons.
                  
                  VI. For in that book of life it is not written indiscriminately, “Those who are to be saved are to be believed,” and “Those who are to be damned,” as opposed to “Those who are not to be believed,” but in that book the names of all who are to be saved are written; nor is this a metaphor taken from the catalogue or index in which the names of those who either by military service or by benefaction are appointed to be received are written. Nor is the meaning of these words, “The Lord knows those who are His,” able to be: “The Lord knows those who are to be saved,” for who does not know this? Certainly even the Devil knows it; but the Apostle says, “The Lord knows those who are His,” indeed truly those whom He is to make His own. And although the certainty of their salvation is not the foundation of their salvation, nevertheless that greatest consolation is taught to us by the Apostle here: “The foundation of God stands firm… The Lord knows those who are His.”
                  
                  VII. There are those who admit some certain and individual Election of men, but think that it contradicts the highest goodness and clemency of God that He reprobates anyone, or rejects anyone from salvation. Indeed, they think that a coming God excludes no one from salvation. But first: If it is permitted to God freely to reprobate, it is permitted also freely to damn anyone whatsoever, whence it would follow that all would be saved, none damned—which is absurd. For although God loves all and wants all to be saved, He nevertheless hates the wicked, the unbelieving, and the finally impenitent; therefore He reprobates them, since He decrees to damn them for the same cause for which He damns them, namely because of sin, unbelief, and final impenitence; therefore He does not damn unless He reprobates first, nor does He reprobate unless it is deserved.
                  
                  VIII. This therefore in God’s goodness and clemency is not repugnant nor contrary. Since God is at once good and just, He does what pertains to justice when He punishes a man guilty of sin; and He does what pertains to goodness when He receives the penitent. But the goodness and clemency of God do not act contrary to the goodness and clemency of God; nor is it permitted to those who are good and merciful to act in a way inconsistent with goodness and clemency. Therefore, although God, according to His most free will, (as freedom is permitted to Him), sometimes judges, condemns, or damns the impious, unbelieving, and impenitent sinners, it is not lawful to object against Him that He should not damn, or that He should not reprobate.
                  
                  IX. Therefore Election cannot be, nor indeed be conceived, without some Reprobation. For God, choosing certain persons into the communion of His grace, passes by the rest whom He does not choose, and wills to pass them by, and indeed with a definite counsel; for He who does nothing without a definite counsel, passed by such with a definite counsel. This is a kind of Reprobation which you may so call, and which they commonly call Negative, whose no other cause is known to us except that it was revealed by the word of God, besides His free will, to which He grants His gifts, or denies them according to His good pleasure.
                  
                  X. To this is joined the Affirmative, namely, that those same unbelieving and impenitent persons He decreed to damn, and to assign to just destruction. For those whom God passes by in the communication and bestowal of grace remain sinners, and shun increasing vices and guilt when the Gospel is offered to them, not by any fault of God, but by their own vice and guilt; therefore they are to be damned and reprobated. Thus Reprobation, as it is opposed to Election, properly and accurately considered, belongs to Praeteritio [passing-by] or desertio [desertion], by which God leaves men in their natural corruption, and permits them to themselves, rather than in the decree of damning the unbelieving and impenitent, and of punishing them according to their merit.
                  
                  XI. Others acknowledge an Election and Reprobation of certain individual men made by God, but dispute about its cause, or concerning its conditions. For some place the cause or the conditions of choosing in His will, others in good works, others in holy life and end, others in faith and perseverance, others in free choice, others in grace alone, and in both attribute something to man (they speak of a praevisum [foreseen] good in man and what God expects from us); but Reprobation they attribute to sin, injustice, unbelief. They follow the opinion of the Socinians, that no act of God precedes except foreknowledge, and that foreknowledge is the cause.
                  
                  XII. Moreover, all sin, and therefore: 1. Because they do not rightly and accurately distinguish Election from grace and from destination to glory, nor distinguish the decree of giving faith from the decree concerning justification through faith; and respect to glory from the respect of sanctification as the effect and the end of faith; nor sanctification from justification through faith. 2. Because they do not place Election as purely gratuitous, as indeed it is able, without any regard to human will or endeavor, so that whatever good is in man whom God expects is not the cause, but the effect of His beneficent choice.
                  
                  XIII. The destination unto eternal life and Glory, that is, the will of God for glorifying man, is not conditioned upon faith and repentance, but is that which God produces in us. But the act itself of the Divine will of giving eternal life under this condition is not accurately speaking the decree of Election, nor is it to be separated from others. The giving of faith, or what is properly Election actualis [actual], and which in time is first brought to effect through calling (whose very beginning and moment is the first act of true faith), is the separation of men who before were equal by nature. As was shown in the preceding disputation, thus the decree of giving faith and the decree of Election are properly to be considered as the same: that is, the decree of choosing and separating certain individuals of men, and hence mentaliter [mentally], as I may say, and in God Himself, made in His very counsel, Election.
                  
                  XIV. Or if you prefer the will of God to give life and salvation, which by its own completeness includes justification and glorification (to call Election the granting of salvation placed under the condition of faith), but that which God Himself, as was said, effects in us, not that which He expects from us as if from our own property, from the freedom of our will, not the effect of grace.
                  
                  XV. If therefore Election be said to be the decree of God for transferring man from the state of his natural corruption into the state of grace, in which by nature we lie, into the kingdom of light and glory, the grace of the sons of God, since (as was said) faith is the first moment of that translation of ours, of our transformation and spiritual renewal, the beginning and moment of this initiation, faith cannot be the cause or condition of that decree whose first effect it is.
                  
                  XVI. That internal and mentalis [mental] act, as we said, Election, that is, the decree of giving faith, cannot have faith, nor perseverance, nor good works, either as its cause or as the condition. Not faith, because faith must precede this, and this would regress into infinity, which is absurd; not perseverance nor good works, because both faith and these follow, whose cause and root is faith; “For by faith the hearts are purified” (Acts 15:9), and from the heart purified by faith the streams of good works flow forth; and the faith of the Elect never fails, because Christ prays for them in the peril of Peter, “that their faith fail not,” Luke 22:32.
                  
                  XVII. Moreover, that good works are not the cause or condition of our Election is clear from Scripture: “When they were not yet born,” or, “before they had done anything good or evil,” it is said, “the elder shall serve the younger” (Romans 9). And the calling of the nations is called according to His own purpose, κατὰ πρόθεσιν [according to purpose], “and the grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal” (2 Timothy 1:9). Where grace and works are opposed, as in Romans 11:6: “And if by grace, it is no more of works, otherwise grace is no more grace.” Then it is said that “we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God prepared that we should walk in them” (Ephesians 2). Therefore, we are not called on account of works which precede, for our calling is not founded upon our works; nor do works follow before our calling; and thus our works do not precede our Election, nor our calling, nor our purpose in God and His decree.
                  
                  XVIII. But neither is the grace of God itself the cause or condition of our Election, nor is God moved by His grace to decree this or that concerning us. For grace is twofold: one objectiva [objective], the other subjectiva [subjective]. The objectiva is Christ, and His merit or satisfaction, which is offered to us by the preaching of the Gospel, and proposed to us for acceptance. The subjectiva is either its efficacy, that is, the inward action of the Spirit, which accompanies the preaching of the Gospel in the Elect, and renders it effective in them; or faith itself and conversion to God through true repentance and sanctification. Since therefore neither objective grace nor subjective grace can be the cause or condition of our Election, nor of the decree of giving faith, nothing foreseen by God can be a cause or condition of our Election.
                  
                  XIX. For if grace be accepted before faith, the good use of faith does not precede faith; and thus it follows that no other good use in the matter of good works can precede faith, nor can any such thing be foreseen, which plainly Scripture teaches not to be. Election therefore has no cause nor condition. The power and efficacy, or the action of the Spirit of God, by which faith is produced in us, of whose efficacy no good use is possible without faith, nor can faith itself, from which sanctification flows forth, nor can the good use of it depend on us but upon the Spirit Himself. But the preaching of the Gospel (which is offered by God for the producing of faith) produces good fruits both in faith itself and in works, and therefore cannot be the cause or condition of the decree of giving faith; for neither can faith itself be both the cause and the effect at the same time.
                  
                  XX. Since Election is accepted as the decree of saving man, no good proceeding from grace (however grace may be accepted) can precede that decree of God, and therefore cannot be placed before it, since its first effect is faith, which the grace of God accomplishes.
                  
                  XXI. But neither can the good of free choice be the cause or condition of our Election. For if anything in man could be the cause or condition of the decree of God of giving faith, or of saving man, it would be free choice, since free choice signifies the faculty of understanding and willing, which is common to all men and natural, since choice is the distinguishing factor among men. But since the purposes of the will arise from this, it is rightly said that one is free who freely proposes, chooses, and embraces something with a willing and cheerful mind. But to propose anything good, to choose it, and to embrace it with cheerful willingness, proceeds from the Spirit of God; but evil, from corrupted nature.
                  
                  XXII. Or free choice signifies a certain active faculty of the will preceding its acts, by which (as some explain it) the will, being in equilibrium and ἀδιάφορος [indifferent], is constituted so that it inclines and is bent of itself either to good or to evil, and is moved (as they explain it) by which it is in our power in all things in which the will can be moved and can act, yet nevertheless is not moved nor bent unless immovably it remain, or also not rarely is bent and moved to the contrary.
                  
                  XXIII. If free choice be understood in the former sense (which is the true and proper sense), its good use is nothing other than the good willing and choosing itself, or right judgment about divine things, which are set before us; the judgment by which faith is produced (in such a way that that judgment is not faith itself), and likewise good affections, and the movements and affections of our will. But this use is not from us, but from God, who in us “both wills and works for His good pleasure,” τὸ θέλειν καὶ τὸ ἐνεργεῖν (Philippians 2:13). For we are not “sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God” (2 Corinthians 3:5). Thus therefore the good use of free choice is the gift of Divine Grace, and the effect of the Holy Spirit (who accompanies the preaching of the Gospel and renders it effective).
                  
                  XXIV. But if free choice be taken in the latter sense, its good use in conceiving faith and embracing the true good would be from ourselves, not from God. Divine Grace, which is given to all (as they imagine), places man in equilibrium and ἀδιάφορον [indifference]; from which then he determines for himself, and of himself, either to good or to evil by the greater inclination of his will through action, without the peculiar effect of the grace of God. But thus to believe and to will the good in the matter of salvation would not be the singular gift of God, but a certain common and merely contingent effect of a certain grace, and one which might be possessed otherwise. This Scripture rejects, since faith and true sanctification, and likewise good works, are the singular gift of God, and the effect of Grace itself alone.
                  
                  XXV. Therefore the power of the will is active, which is not bent nor moved by objects: it moves and bends itself, even contrary to what objects persuade, against the arguments of the Sophists, and contrary to right reason and the teachings of true philosophy. For the conjunction of the intellect and will in us is so ordered, that no human being does anything unless the intellect first shows and judges that it is a good thing; it is necessary that he be drawn to it, or voluntarily apply himself to it, or assent to that which the intellect judges as good.
                  
                  XXVI. But truly in divine things and divine objects, and in things necessary for salvation, from God and by His Grace, the illumination of His Spirit itself, the efficacy and enlightenings of the true good, the intellect is illuminated by the preaching of the Gospel and Christ presented to us; to us it seems such, and is accepted with assent, and necessarily the will follows it with an immutable consent, although it wills freely and voluntarily.
                  
                  XXVII. But when that illumination of the Spirit is absent, our intellect, in this corruption and stain of our nature in which we are born, cannot perceive the true Good, nor judge it from the midst of those things which lead to it, nor from consequence reject, despise, repudiate, and neglect those things. But indeed man is not excused on account of that vice and corruption by which he is turned away from these things; for in this lies that which is said, namely, τὸ φρόνημα τῆς σαρκὸς ἔχθρα εἰς Θεόν [the mind of the flesh is enmity toward God], is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be (Romans 8:7). But this has been fully demonstrated above in the disputation on the Nature of faith.
                  
                  XXVIII. Free choice, or the faculty of willing, in producing faith and sanctification is not so much said to cooperate with Grace as, so to speak, to be suboperated [acted-under] by Grace, not that it cooperates with Grace toward that effect, as a horse draws equally with another horse what one alone cannot draw. But Grace moves the will, not as one who wills badly, but as one who wills well, and truly so wills, and under the motion of Grace, that is, of the Spirit of God, the action of the will is moved. Thus suboperatur [acts-under] is rightly said rather than cooperatur [cooperates], since nothing is attributed to man which is his own, since the whole is of God Himself, so that Grace is causalis [causal], although not substituens [substituting].
                  
                  XXIX. Nor is our cooperation with Grace to be taken otherwise than as the Fathers often speak, as when they call it suboperation [acting-under], which can be explained from the words of the same Fathers, who express that suboperation. “Speaking through the Prophet, God Himself confirms that He gives to the faithful to do according to that very command, ‘I will make you to walk in My statutes, and you shall keep My judgments and do them’” (Ezekiel 36:27). What therefore remains for you to do? What is my part of good work which You have not done? He Himself makes us to do; and therefore what we do, He in us truly does. But for that reason our doing does not cease to be ours, because He alone makes us to do what pleases before Him. Without therefore believing, nothing is done; our works are our faith and the works of our faith; but since we have nothing which we did not receive, we have nothing except what God gives. As the Apostle says, “We have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us by God” (1 Corinthians 2:12). And “if we have anything to do, since He gives, we can do nothing unless He gives; thus if He gives to us, we can do what He gives to be done.”
                  
                  XXX. From these things it is plain that no condition can be placed on God, nor from us to God in His decree of Election; nor does any consent or free choice compete with Grace, being human and ours, since such consent could not be pure unless God worked it and effected it in us. Likewise free choice is not the cause of Faith, which arises from the pure fountain of God, who works and moves in us both to will and to do by His Grace. For since Grace precedes and concurs in all that is good, and whatever is in us that is good arises from God alone, man can attribute nothing to himself, nor glory except in God the giver.
                  
                  XXXI. But with respect to Reprobation, if it be taken as the destination ad mortem [appointment unto death], or as the decree of God for damning man, and a cause be sought why God decrees certain persons to damnation, it cannot be other than the sin of man, unbelief, and final impenitence. For God is unjust if He punishes the innocent; He condemns none without sin committed, nor does He decree to damn except on account of their sins.
                  
                  XXXII. But if Reprobation be taken as Praeteritio [passing-by], or derelictio [desertion], and a cause be sought why God rather leaves that one in the corruption of his nature, and passes that one by in the communion and dispensation of His grace, nothing else can be said or answered except this: that He so willed, who is bound to none, and freely, as to the distribution of His gifts, grants or denies to whom He wills. For rightly does Prosper say (De Vocatione, book 1, chapter 28): “Though the mass of the impious receive the common gifts, they nevertheless, remaining in their wills and corrupt manners, cannot be corrected; nor can those be favored who are of the number of the inflexible, who, while left by God, remain in their own hardness, nor receive the grace that softens the heart, which ought to be given, and the judgment of God is inscrutable both in the grace of Election and in the righteous distribution of justice.”
                  
                  XXXIII. From this follows the opinion of those who acknowledge Election to be purely gracious and free, and faith the pure and unmixed gift of God, yet do not seem sufficiently to establish the object of Election and Reprobation. For they will have that object to be man not fallen into sin and misery, but either created simply, or not yet fallen, or even creabilis, that is, as they speak, “possible” in the mind and conception of God.
                  
                  XXXIV. But whether Election is the decree of giving faith, that is, the counsel of saving man, and of giving salvation which in calling is effected, in justification, sanctification, and glorification placed; and Reprobation is called the decree of damning, according to the foreseen delinquency of man in which he plunged himself further into corruption, the same in the communion of grace being passed by, remains a sinner, and because of his vice and guilt is appointed to misery and damnation, or whether a man in the mere act of falling be taken as the object.
                  
                  XXXV. For faith is not given except to a sinful man, nor except for his consolation and for hope to be raised up out of that misery into which he is born. Nor is Christ patient, nor does the divine justice satisfying for us (which is the proper object of faith) pertain to any other, nor could it pertain, than to a man miserable through sin, and to be raised and freed from that miserable state, whether to be saved, or to be delivered from death, and that by reason of sin committed and deserving to perish; and it is not strange that the mind cannot conceive God decreeing man as not miserable, not a sinner, to save him, but rather to give him faith in Christ, and through Him to justify, sanctify, and bring to the same glory in the heavens, both in soul and in body.
                  
                  XXXVI. What else can Election be except that decree concerning saving man and giving faith? What else can Reprobation be except that decree concerning the same man to be damned, or to be passed by and left in the communion of grace? Election, therefore, cannot be without Reprobation, for Election is between two: one is received and destined to be saved, the other, the same one not being received, is passed by, and by reason of grace, and from the consequence, excluded and rejected from salvation. Therefore if God in Election and Reprobation were to consider man not as fallen and miserable, but as merely creabilis [capable of being created] and possibilis [possible], He would reject the possible man from salvation, and decree him to damnation, without consideration of their sins, a thing from which every sound mind recoils.
                  
                  XXXVII. But even if God be in His most absolute dominion over creatures, and in His highest and infinite ἐξουσίᾳ [authority], it were possible for Him to make an innocent creature miserable—if, that is, you consider Him insofar as He does not communicate blessedness—yet this is one thing to say, another to attribute it as injury to anyone, as if the creature could complain that it could not obtain that which was not owed to it. Likewise, it is one thing to say that God cannot be compelled by the creature to do anything, but another to say that He is not able freely, because He is just and merciful. Because He is just, He renders to each one what is due, and therefore does not punish except according to the merit of sin; and because He is merciful, He does not desert or eternally condemn any man except on account of sin, for He cannot decree nor destine except as He considers the sinner.
                  
                  XXXVIII. But insofar as God is merciful, He is indeed inclined to free man the sinner from misery and death in which he lies prostrate; and it could happen that He would destine man to life, unless against this His justice were opposed, which regards the sinner as deserving death, unless he should repent, turn to God, and be reconciled to Him by faith, and by the intervention of satisfaction mercifully be forgiven. Although He acts most freely, and as He wills, being good, just, and merciful, yet the merciful will could not prevail over the just will; and because He is good, just, and merciful.
                  
                  XXXIX. But neither does the absoluteness of that modus of the divine dominion pertain properly to the decree of Reprobation, nor is that decree supported or founded upon it, but solely upon the liberty of God in the communication of His grace, if Reprobation is accepted as praeteritio [passing-by] and dereliction, or His justice if it is understood as a decree of condemning.
                  
                  XL. With these things thus set forth, it is clear that in Election there is nothing of which man could in any way glory, since he has nothing of good which he did not receive from God. If you received it, why do you boast as if you had not received it? And neither in Reprobation is there anything of which man may complain of God. For God condemns no one by His act except the sinner, and He condemns no one except him who truly deserved such, so that in the just judgment of God the sinner is condemned, and is punished according to his sins. And on the other hand, the sinner is saved by the grace of God, and through faith in that salvation, received both from the goodness and grace of God. And though the sinner be hardened, whom God leaves in that sin and misery of his own mind and obstinacy, nevertheless he cannot but at once hear that word: O man, who are you who answers back to God? (Rom. 9:20).
                  
                  XLI. This is that which has been until now explained to us from the mind of Scripture concerning the election-dogma and the reprobation-dogma, that the decree of God is most free, and proceeds, I think, from His beneficent pleasure; that it does not depend upon any antecedent condition in man, nor upon any antecedent thing in man, nor upon any work, nor upon faith, nor upon perseverance, nor upon the good use of free will; but that the good pleasure of grace alone has regard to the decree of Election; that sin, and unbelief, or impenitence, has regard to that decree of Reprobation, which we said is to be compared with a negation.
                  
                  XLII. And this Bellarmine himself acknowledges and confesses (lib. 2. de Grat. cap. 9. Divina quinque): “Predestination on God’s part is, as it were, a certain purpose of His will concerning the salvation of those to be saved.” We say that the same intention most certainly belongs to divine Election, and we exclude not only works, but also any good use of free will, or gratia, or perseverance itself, from God’s intention. We add that this is done not without the most just judgment of God, by which some are predestined unto salvation, others are hardened; for mercy is given to whom it is given, and justice is owed to whom it is owed; and.
                  
                  XLIII. Therefore with Augustine (cited there in the same place by Bellarmine) we conclude this Disputation: “For if God had not given grace, no one would deserve anything except punishment.” And, “The judgments of God are most righteous, and most hidden from us.” And the Apostle is amazed saying, “O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God… Who has been His counselor?” (Rom. 11). When therefore He “has mercy on whom He wills, and whom He wills He hardens,” yet His ways cannot be unrighteous, because the effect of His will is justice itself. Hence Augustine rightly adds: Ad Simplic. lib. 1: “Moreover, when He says, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will harden whom I will harden, He shows that He has mercy freely, and He hardens freely. But He does not harden in such a way as to cause sin, but He hardens by judgment and forsaking.” And again, “What, shall we say? Is there unrighteousness with God?”
                  
                  XLIV. Thus also Augustine’s disciple Prosper of Aquitaine, in the Responsiones ad excerpta Genuensium: “When certain persons perish, we do not doubt that they are to be reckoned to that which they have deserved; those whom God deigns mercifully to free, if He wills, are freed. And since some are justly damned, you do not dare to assign what they deserved to be freed; those whom God wills justly to damn, He may justly damn. Why therefore are not all freed, or why rather are some freed rather than others, it is not necessary to seek; nor is it possible to know, since, all the causes of His decisions being omitted, nothing more can be known than that neither mercy fails Him, nor justice deserts mercy, with whom no one is condemned except one deserving, nor is any one freed except one whom mercy sets free.”
                  
                  FINIS.
                  
                  
                  
                  Predestination embraces both our conversion and our justification and our glorification.
                  
                  Fulgentius to Monimus: “All these things, that is, both the beginnings of our calling and the increases of our justification and the rewards of glorification, God has always had in predestination, because both in calling and in justification and in the glorification of the saints He has accomplished the works of His grace.”
                  
                  In predestination He has foreordained the grace of the glorification of the saints by His own works, that is, He has preordained it, not by foreseeing it.
                  
                  But predestination, that is, Election, the decree of giving faith, that is, of converting a man, can be understood.
                  
                  Fulgentius to Monimus: “The knowledge therefore of predestination itself—which, as the witness of Scripture shows, the will is prepared by the Lord, not the will of man prepared by man himself.” And soon after: “Therefore it is the work of predestination that the will is prepared by the Lord, since our will is not prepared by our own merit, but by the mercy of God alone.” Whence it is clear that predestination is to be placed, according to Fulgentius, in that by which the will is given by God, and this is that which is said in Acts: “For by faith their hearts are purified.”
