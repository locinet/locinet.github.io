        sections:
          - introductory-the-subject-of-this-treatise-the-humiliation-an: "Introductory.--The subject of this treatise: the humiliation and incarnation of the Word. Presupposes the doctrine of Creation, and that by the Word. The Father has saved the world by Him through Whom he first made it."
            # loci:
          - erroneous-views-of-creation-rejected-1-epicurean-fortuitous-: "Erroneous views of Creation rejected. (1) Epicurean (fortuitous generation). But diversity of bodies and parts argues a creating intellect. (2.) Platonists (pre-existent matter.) But this subjects God to human limitations, making Him not a creator but a mechanic. (3) Gnostics (an alien Demiurge). Rejected from Scripture."
            # loci:
          - the-true-doctrine-creation-out-of-nothing-of-gods-lavish-bou: "The true doctrine. Creation out of nothing, of God's lavish bounty of being. Man created above the rest, but incapable of independent perseverance. Hence the exceptional and supra-natural gift of being in God's Image, with the promise of bliss conditionally upon his perseverance in grace."
            # loci:
          - our-creation-and-gods-incarnation-most-intimately-connected-: "Our creation and God's Incarnation most intimately connected. As by the Word man was called from non-existence into being, and further received the grace of a divine life, so by the one fault which forfeited that life they again incurred corruption and untold sin and misery filled the world."
            # loci:
          - for-god-has-not-only-made-us-out-of-nothing-but-he-gave-us-f: "For God has not only made us out of nothing; but He gave us freely, by the Grace of the Word, a life in correspondence with God."
            # loci:
          - the-human-race-then-was-wasting-gods-image-was-being-effaced: "The human race then was wasting, God's image was being effaced, and His work ruined. Either, then, God must forego His spoken word by which man had incurred ruin; or that which had shared in the being of the Word must sink back again into destruction, in which case God's design would be defeated. What then? was God's goodness to suffer this? But if so, why had man been made? It could have been weakness, not goodness on God's part."
            # loci:
          - on-the-other-hand-there-was-the-consistency-of-gods-nature-n: "On the other hand there was the consistency of God's nature, not to be sacrificed for our profit. Were men, then, to be called upon to repent? But repentance cannot avert the execution of a law; still less can it remedy a fallen nature. We have incurred corruption and need to be restored to the Grace of God's Image. None could renew but He Who had created. He alone could (1) recreate all, (2) suffer for all, (3) represent all to the Father."
            # loci:
          - the-word-then-visited-that-earth-in-which-he-was-yet-always-: "The Word, then, visited that earth in which He was yet always present ; and saw all these evils. He takes a body of our Nature, and that of a spotless Virgin, in whose womb He makes it His own, wherein to reveal Himself, conquer death, and restore life."
            # loci:
          - the-word-since-death-alone-could-stay-the-plague-took-a-mort: "The Word, since death alone could stay the plague, took a mortal body which, united with Him, should avail for all, and by partaking of His immortality stay the corruption of the Race. By being above all, He made His Flesh an offering for our souls; by being one with us all, he clothed us with immortality. Simile to illustrate this."
            # loci:
          - by-a-like-simile-the-reasonableness-of-the-work-of-redemptio: "By a like simile, the reasonableness of the work of redemption is shewn. How Christ wiped away our ruin, and provided its antidote by His own teaching. Scripture proofs of the Incarnation of the Word, and of the Sacrifice He wrought."
            # loci:
          - second-reason-for-the-incarnation-god-knowing-that-man-was-n: "Second reason for the Incarnation. God, knowing that man was not by nature sufficient to know Him, gave him, in order that he might have some profit in being, a knowledge of Himself. He made them in the Image of the Word, that thus they might know the Word, and through Him the Father. Yet man, despising this, fell into idolatry, leaving the unseen God for magic and astrology; and all this in spite of God's manifold revelation of Himself."
            # loci:
          - for-though-man-was-created-in-grace-god-foreseeing-his-forge: "For though man was created in grace, God, foreseeing his forgetfulness, provided also the works of creation to remind man of him. Yet further, He ordained a Law and Prophets, whose ministry was meant for all the world. Yet men heeded only their own lusts."
            # loci:
          - here-again-was-god-to-keep-silence-to-allow-to-false-gods-th: "Here again, was God to keep silence? to allow to false gods the worship He made us to render to Himself? A king whose subjects had revolted would, after sending letters and messages, go to them in person. How much more shall God restore in us the grace of His image. This men, themselves but copies, could not do. Hence the Word Himself must come (1) to recreate, (2) to destroy death in the Body."
            # loci:
          - a-portrait-once-effaced-must-be-restored-from-the-original-t: "A portrait once effaced must be restored from the original. Thus the Son of the Father came to seek, save, and regenerate. No other way was possible. Blinded himself, man could not see to heal. The witness of creation had failed to preserve him, and could not bring him back. The Word alone could do so. But how? Only by revealing Himself as Man."
            # loci:
          - thus-the-word-condescended-to-mans-engrossment-in-corporeal-: "Thus the Word condescended to man's engrossment in corporeal things, by even taking a body. All man's superstitions He met halfway; whether men were inclined to worship Nature, Man, Demons, or the dead, He shewed Himself Lord of all these."
            # loci:
          - he-came-then-to-attract-mans-sense-bound-attention-to-himsel: "He came then to attract man's sense-bound attention to Himself as man, and so to lead him on to know Him as God."
            # loci:
          - how-the-incarnation-did-not-limit-the-ubiquity-of-the-word-n: "How the Incarnation did not limit the ubiquity of the Word, nor diminish His Purity. (Simile of the Sun.)"
            # loci:
          - how-the-word-and-power-of-god-works-in-his-human-actions-by-: "How the Word and Power of God works in His human actions: by casting out devils, by Miracles, by His Birth of the Virgin."
            # loci:
          - man-unmoved-by-nature-was-to-be-taught-to-know-god-by-that-s: "Man, unmoved by nature, was to be taught to know God by that sacred Manhood, Whose deity all nature confessed, especially in His Death."
            # loci:
          - none-then-could-bestow-incorruption-but-he-who-had-made-none: "None, then, could bestow incorruption, but He Who had made, none restore the likeness of God, save His Own Image, none quicken, but the Life, none teach, but the Word. And He, to pay our debt of death, must also die for us, and rise again as our first-fruits from the grave. Mortal therefore His Body must be; corruptible, His Body could not be."
            # loci:
          - death-brought-to-nought-by-the-death-of-christ-why-then-did-: "Death brought to nought by the death of Christ. Why then did not Christ die privately, or in a more honourable way? He was not subject to natural death, but had to die at the hands of others. Why then did He die? Nay but for that purpose He came, and but for that, He could not have risen."
            # loci:
          - but-why-did-he-not-withdraw-his-body-from-the-jews-and-so-gu: "But why did He not withdraw His body from the Jews, and so guard its immortality? (1) It became Him not to inflict death on Himself, and yet not to shun it. (2) He came to receive death as the due of others, therefore it should come to Him from without. (3) His death must be certain, to guarantee the truth of His Resurrection. Also, He could not die from infirmity, lest He should be mocked in His healing of others."
            # loci:
          - necessity-of-a-public-death-for-the-doctrine-of-the-resurrec: Necessity of a public death for the doctrine of the Resurrection.
            # loci:
          - further-objections-anticipated-he-did-not-choose-his-manner-: "Further objections anticipated. He did not choose His manner of death; for He was to prove Conqueror of death in all or any of its forms: (simile of a good wrestler). The death chosen to disgrace Him proved the Trophy against death: moreover it preserved His body undivided."
            # loci:
          - why-the-cross-of-all-deaths-1-he-had-to-bear-the-curse-for-u: "Why the Cross, of all deaths? (1) He had to bear the curse for us. (2) On it He held out His hands to unite all, Jews and Gentiles, in Himself. (3) He defeated the “Prince of the powers of the air” in His own region, clearing the way to heaven and opening for us the everlasting doors."
            # loci:
          - reasons-for-his-rising-on-the-third-day-1-not-sooner-for-els: "Reasons for His rising on the Third Day. (1) Not sooner for else His real death would be denied, nor (2) later; to (a) guard the identity of His body, (b) not to keep His disciples too long in suspense, nor (c) to wait till the witnesses of His death were dispersed, or its memory faded."
            # loci:
          - the-change-wrought-by-the-cross-in-the-relation-of-death-to-: The change wrought by the Cross in the relation of Death to Man.
            # loci:
          - this-exceptional-fact-must-be-tested-by-experience-let-those: This exceptional fact must be tested by experience. Let those who doubt it become Christians.

          - the-reality-of-the-resurrection-proved-by-facts-1-the-victor: "The reality of the resurrection proved by facts: (1) the victory over death described above: (2) the Wonders of Grace are the work of One Living, of One who is God: (3) if the gods be (as alleged) real and living, a fortiori He Who shatters their power is alive."
            # loci:
          - if-power-is-the-sign-of-life-what-do-we-learn-from-the-impot: "If Power is the sign of life, what do we learn from the impotence of idols, for good or evil, and the constraining power of Christ and of the Sign of the Cross? Death and the demons are by this proved to have lost their sovereignty. Coincidence of the above argument from facts with that from the Personality of Christ."
            # loci:
          - but-who-is-to-see-him-risen-so-as-to-believe-nay-god-is-ever: "But who is to see Him risen, so as to believe? Nay, God is ever invisible and known by His works only: and here the works cry out in proof. If you do not believe, look at those who do, and perceive the Godhead of Christ. The demons see this, though men be blind. Summary of the argument so far."
            # loci:
          - unbelief-of-jews-and-scoffing-of-greeks-the-former-confounde: Unbelief of Jews and scoffing of Greeks. The former confounded by their own Scriptures. Prophecies of His coming as God and as Man.

            # loci:
          - answer-to-the-greeks-do-they-recognise-the-logos-if-he-manif: "Answer to the Greeks. Do they recognise the Logos? If He manifests Himself in the organism of the Universe, why not in one Body? for a human body is a part of the same whole."
            # loci:
          - his-union-with-the-body-is-based-upon-his-relation-to-creati: "His union with the body is based upon His relation to Creation as a whole. He used a human body, since to man it was that He wished to reveal Himself."
            # loci:
          - he-came-in-human-rather-than-in-any-nobler-form-because-i-he: "He came in human rather than in any nobler form, because (I) He came to save, not to impress ; (2) man alone of creatures had sinned. As men would not recognise His works in the Universe, He came and worked among them as Man; in the sphere to which they had limited themselves."
            # loci:
          - as-god-made-man-by-a-word-why-not-restore-him-by-a-word-but-: "As God made man by a word, why not restore him by a word? But (1) creation out of nothing is different from reparation of what already exists. (2) Man was there with a definite need, calling for a definite remedy. Death was ingrained in man's nature: He then must wind life closely to human nature. Therefore the Word became Incarnate that He might meet and conquer death in His usurped territory. (Simile of straw and asbestos.)"
            # loci:
          - thus-once-again-every-part-of-creation-manifests-the-glory-o: "Thus once again every part of creation manifests the glory of God. Nature, the witness to her Creator, yields (by miracles) a second testimony to God Incarnate. The witness of Nature, perverted by man's sin, was thus forced back to truth. If these reasons suffice not, let the Greeks look at facts."

          - discredit-from-the-date-of-the-incarnation-of-idol-cultus-or: "Discredit, from the date of the Incarnation, of idol-cultus, oracles, mythologies, demoniacal energy, magic, and Gentile philosophy. And whereas the old cults were strictly local and independent, the worship of Christ is catholic and uniform."
            # loci:
          - the-numerous-oracles-fancied-apparitions-in-sacred-places-c-: "The numerous oracles,--fancied apparitions in sacred places, &c., dispelled by the sign of the Cross. The old gods prove to have been mere men. Magic is exposed. And whereas Philosophy could only persuade select and local cliques of Immortality, and goodness,--men of little intellect have infused into the multitudes of the churches the principle of a supernatural life."
            # loci:
          - further-facts-christian-continence-of-virgins-and-ascetics-m: "Further facts. Christian continence of virgins and ascetics. Martyrs. The power of the Cross against demons and magic. Christ by His Power shews Himself more than a man, more than a magician, more than a spirit. For all these are totally subject to Him. Therefore He is the Word of God."

          - the-word-incarnate-as-is-the-case-with-the-invisible-god-is-: "The Word Incarnate, as is the case with the Invisible God, is known to us by His works. By them we recognise His deifying mission. Let us be content to enumerate a few of them, leaving their dazzling plentitude to him who will behold."
