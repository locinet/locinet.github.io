alting-methodus: # Every work should have its own YAML file, which should start with a unique identifier in the format authorid-shorttitle. Use one word identifiers where possible. A work is a distinct creation , not an individual expression of that work. For example, Calvin's Institutes is a work with multiple editions. The editions would be represented within the same work file under the editions level of the tree.
