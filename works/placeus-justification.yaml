              These Theses on the Justification of Man before God, in due observance and as a token of grateful affection, I offer to you, Joshua Placaeus.
              
              THESIS I Concerning the Justification of Man before God, in which the entire heart of our religion and salvation turns, it is fitting that we speak briefly and simply, as befits Christians, first concerning the word itself, then concerning the thing itself, since the meaning of both is not commonly agreed upon among all.
              
              To justify in this matter is to make just, or to do justice, or to declare just. The word justus [just] can be taken either in a moral or a forensic sense. In the moral sense, it is opposed to τοῦ ἀδίκου [the unrighteous], and in whatever way it signifies, the one who is endowed with that virtue, which is called justice, is said to be just, whether he already possesses it or will possess it afterward. In the forensic sense, it is opposed to τοῦ κατακρίνειν [to condemn], and in whatever way it signifies, it is not lawful to act according to the law, since one cannot justly be condemned by the judge, much less punished.
              
              II. To justify does not in this matter signify to make just morally, by infusing into the soul of the ungodly man a habit of justice. For first, the Apostle, who so often and so accurately treats of justification, never uses it in that sense. Further, the question formerly debated among the Jews was not whether righteousness could be introduced into men by works of the law or by faith, but whether the habit of righteousness was present in the soul beforehand or would be afterward. Thirdly, justification is not to be confused with sanctification; and the state of the controversy concerning justification is altogether different.
              
              III. Neither again does it signify to declare someone morally just (unless insofar as it is understood that one is morally just, the same is also said to be just in relation to the forum). For the matter in this controversy is not about the nature by which the habit of righteousness is introduced into the soul (for that pertains to the controversy of sanctification). Thus, it is not about the reason by which that habit is afterward declared.
              
              IV. But it signifies to make just, or to do justice, or to declare just, in the forensic sense. This meaning, both in the Old and New Testament, occurs everywhere, and is used by the Apostle whenever he disputes concerning justification. For he makes mention of the wrath of God, of the divine judgment, of guilt, of condemnation, of accusation, of the curse of the law. Then he opposes justification directly to accusation and to condemnation. Thirdly, he explains justification through imputed righteousness and victory in judgment. Fourthly, he places our justification in the remission of sins. Fifthly, it cannot be understood otherwise in that conclusion of his in Romans 3:20, nor is it consistent with David’s confession in Psalm 143:2. Sixthly, he distinguishes justification from sanctification, not only in name but also in series of disputation.
              
              Romans 1:18; 8:1–2, 33, 19, 16; Ephesians 8:33; Galatians 3:10; Romans 3:23–25, 18; 4:6–8.
              
              V. Furthermore, it agrees with reason that we accept the word in the controversy of justification, not as the philosophers understand it, but as it is most frequent in the controversy itself, and constantly most frequently found in the Holy Scriptures, rather than as it is sometimes used outside the Scriptures. For it is not fitting for Christians to dispute about the things of God using words of uncertain meaning.
              
              1 Timothy 6:4.
              
              VI. To this is added the fact that in the souls of men there arises a thought of justification, born without doubt out of fear of divine judgment and the wrath to come. For since Scripture everywhere proclaims, and conscience silently within confirms, sound reason sufficiently demonstrating, that there is established a divine judgment-seat, at which account will be rendered for all deeds, words, and thoughts, and the condemned will remain under eternal punishment, there is nothing of which mortals ought to be more solicitous than by what reason, if they should hold to it and attain it, they might be justified in the judgment of God and escape His wrath, since universal religion tends to this very point.
              
              VII. But whether to justify, to make just, or to declare just are to be taken according to the forensic [forensica] signification, as was set forth above, does not seem to be of great importance in reference to the matter itself, since God does not declare just anyone whom He has not made just. Therefore, those who are justified are constituted just, endowed with righteousness, to whom righteousness is imputed by the Apostle. Nevertheless, from the usage of Scripture, it is proper to signify the thing done judicially, that is, to absolve the just man or to declare him just.
              
              Romans 5:19; 8:16–17; 4.
              
              VIII. Thus far concerning the word. Now as to the matter itself, to the extent that it is known to us, it may be explained under two complex questions: first, What is that righteousness by which in the divine forum we are constituted just, and to which unjust ones, not as a sign, nor according to an argument of possession or future possession, but as one giving redemption from punishment, and as one granting eternal life, are vindicated? The second: How can that righteousness become ours so as to compose us of righteousness?
              
              IX. Concerning the first question, the matter must be premised. First, since God attributed to man by nature a law-capable reason, He decided to establish law. For He implanted within the conscience of man a kind of law, by which he naturally discerns between honorable and shameful, just and unjust, and performs all the functions of law in the innermost parts of the soul; therefore it is called the lex naturae [law of nature], which, although sin somewhat destroyed, it did not thoroughly abolish. After that, the Law of Moses was added to the people of Israel, delivered externally, first by living voice, then in writing, comprising three parts: moral, ceremonial, and political. By the law of nature, the Gentiles rejoiced; by both, the Israelites rejoiced. In the matter of justification, the same reason holds for both, for the same is required of us to be justified, namely, perfect obedience. Moreover, the law by itself has no authority to constitute penalties for transgressors of the law, unless a judge and tribunal exist.
              
              Romans 2:14–15.
              
              X. Furthermore, there are altogether two reasons by which one may be justified in judgment: one κατὰ τὸ ἀρνεῖσθαι [according to denying], when he who is accused of transgressing the law has not transgressed, but is accused falsely. The other κατὰ τὸ χεῖρον [according to acknowledging guilt], when the accused has indeed violated the law, but the grace of the sin has been obtained from him in whose supreme power it is to pardon, as He is the author of every right.
              
              XI. There are two wholly opposite reasons for justification, so that the one relies on the other, but renounces the other. For he who denies the crime professes that he does not need the prince’s pardon, while he who relies on mercy and on the grace of the prince’s justification confesses his guilt and openly acknowledges that he is liable to punishment.
              
              Romans 11:6.
              
              XII. By the former reason, which he calls κατὰ νόμον καὶ ἔργα τοῦ νόμου καὶ κατὰ τὸ ὀφείλειν, the Apostle contends that no flesh can be justified before God. For the Law does not justify, but condemns transgressors of the Law. We are all, both the Gentiles and the Jews, transgressors of the Law, the Gentiles indeed of the Law of nature, but the Jews of the Law of Moses. Therefore we are so far from being able to be justified before God by the Law, that even the very sentence of the Law condemns us as transgressors. (Galatians 3:21; Romans 3:20; Romans 7:10; Romans 3:9; Romans 9:8; Galatians 2:11; Galatians 3:11.)
              
              XIII. Nor indeed should it be thought possible that we could be justified by the Law, at least in some part. For before the Law, one is either a transgressor or not a transgressor. If one is not a transgressor, one is justified by the Law; if one is a transgressor, one is condemned. There cannot be any middle state between transgression and non-transgression of the Law. Therefore, we can in no way be justified by the Law.
              
              XIV. For he who has violated any condition of the covenant, even though he has observed the remaining conditions, is held guilty of violating the covenant. Therefore, whoever wishes to rely on circumcision for justification, when it does not avail, or on any other condition of the legal covenant, is, according to the Apostle, bound to keep the whole Law, being condemned since he has failed in one point. (Galatians 5:3.)
              
              XV. Therefore, by neither preceding nor subsequent good works is the guilt of sin once committed removed. For neither does the murderer escape condemnation because he performed good deeds in other years, nor does one absolve himself by having omitted homicide after committing it, nor by any unwillingness to repeat it. Each day, hour, and moment, the Law demands from us obedience as perfect as that which was possible at the time when the Law was to be obeyed: and at that very time, even if no new sin has been committed, previous sins remain bound, unless the due penalty formerly contracted is dissolved by another way.
              
              XVI. From where then good works of ours proceeded, whether from our own free will or from the grace of the Holy Spirit, just as our justification is received solely by the grace of the Holy Spirit, so our justification does not inquire according to the Law from where it proceeded, nor whether you performed it in that manner, but it inquires not at all. Just as, in the judgment according to the Gospel, it is not asked from where the deed arose that you believed, but only whether you believed. Therefore, if it were possible that anyone, by the powers of his own free will, without the operation of the Holy Spirit, truly believed in Christ, he would indeed be justified before God, because faith is impressed into whose soul by the Holy Spirit. For before God, the manner whereby the Holy Spirit inscribed faith is not considered. (Galatians 3:2; Romans 11.)
              
              XVII. Therefore, the Law was not given for this purpose, that sinners might be justified by it. For sin is not covered by the Law, but is detected; it is not removed, but is increased; it is not quenched, but is revived; it does not take away the force by which it brings condemnation and death, indeed its force is such that it is rightly called the ministratio mortis et condemnationis [ministry of death and condemnation], not by any fault of itself, for it is holy and good, but on our part, who are captive under τῆς ἁμαρτίας [sin].
              
              Romans 3:20; 5:20; 7:11; 7:9; 1 Corinthians 15:56; 2 Corinthians 3:7, 3:9; Romans 7:12, 7:14.
              
              XVIII. It did indeed seem, in appearance, that the ceremonial law took away sin; yet it was far from doing so or removing it, so that, on the contrary, it was like a promissory note, by which the one guilty of death with his own hand wrote that he could not obtain remission of sins unless a mediating victim were interposed, who would die in his place. (Colossians 2:14.)
              
              XIX. There is, however, another law more inward, namely the law of justification itself, which makes us understand by inner experience that we are all ὑπόδικοι τῷ Θεῷ [guilty before God], and that the righteousness of our works is useless in the judgment of God. From this follows the one only conclusion of justification before God, namely that of grace, as God has more clearly revealed in the Gospel, which He had already dimly shown in the law.
              
              Galatians 3:2; Romans 2.
              
              XX. The remission of sins in the divine law can only be granted by Him who possesses supreme judicial and consciential authority, without whom no conscience can rightly be at peace. But outside of God, no one is found whose authority before the tribunal of God might avail, so that he could by right procure remission of the guilt of sin; since no one is equal to God except the one who, being of divine authority, is no less than the law which was violated.
              
              Romans 3:20; 5:20; 7:11; 7:9; 1 Corinthians 15:56; 2 Corinthians 3:7–9; Romans 7:12; 7:14.
              
              XXI. Yet it cannot happen that God should grant grace without a corresponding satisfaction of justice. For since He established the Law among men, pronouncing penalties against transgressors of the Law, and since He Himself was established as Judge by the nature of His supreme majesty, it would be contrary to His judicial office to justify and acquit the guilty without satisfaction intervening, even if he were guilty but penitent.
              
              XXII. Nor indeed could a tacit condition of repentance be added to the remission of sins declared by the Law, as if it were the meaning of the Law that the one transgressing it should, by repentance, satisfy the Law, and thus be able to be absolved by the Judge, not now by grace, but by right, since he then would have satisfied the Law, and the Judge, by right, would be bound to acquit or justify.
              
              XXIII. But it does not conflict with the office of the Judge to grant grace entirely and without satisfaction; yet satisfaction can be conceived which is not joined with the damage of the public treasury, even if grace is granted, as is fitting for the Judge, because it is pleasing to the supreme majesty to preserve the honor of the law. For the measure of whatever is possible, no law of dignity of law can be violated.
              
              XXIV. But neither can man satisfy for himself or for others, because whatever the law requires according to justice must be paid; this condition of the law cannot be changed. The Law indeed demands not only the removal of guilt, but also perfect obedience in the future; unless there be satisfaction, no justice is satisfied. Moreover, he who scornfully violates infinite dignity, whether of the Law or of the one offended, sins so grievously that, if he could suffer punishment according to the infinite magnitude of the Law, which no mere creature can, much less a sinner, eternal punishment would be incurred. From this it is understood that no one but God could satisfy God for sinners.
              
              XXV. But indeed God could not suffer death, nor would it seem equitable that the innocent should be punished for the guilty, with whom He has neither any natural nor voluntary fellowship. Therefore, He who was to satisfy for us must not only be God, but also man, of the same blood, from which the entire human race sprang, and so closely associated with those for whom He would satisfy, and being the head of them all, He would be reckoned together with them in God’s judgment.
              
              XXVI. Yet it was fitting that He should not suffer unwillingly, but that He should be driven, not against His will, to suffer for us, whether by the command or by the approval of the supreme magistrate, that is, of God. But it was also necessary that He who was to satisfy for us should first fulfill all righteousness, by fulfilling the Law in all things, and by living a most holy life, and by most thoroughly discharging the duties of justice. Then, finally, He should allow Himself to be offered as a victim, by the eternal Spirit, to God, which, for our sins, should undergo death, and would taste in His conscience the curse and condemnation joined to sin.
              
              XXVII. Yet it was not necessary, nor truly useful for us, to be buried under death eternally. For if He who truly is God had endured the punishment of death for a time, when He had loosed and freed all men from eternal death by His death, we would have perished, if our vessel had not been partaker of that deliverance. 
              
              1 Corinthians 15.
              
              XXVIII. From this it is understood that there is neither remission of sins without satisfaction, nor any satisfaction other than that which Christ, God manifested in the flesh, rendered on our behalf, made for us ἁμαρτία καὶ κατάρα [sin and curse], and afterward, having received justification from the Father at His resurrection, advanced to the fullest glorification. 
              
              2 Corinthians 5:21; Galatians 3:13.
              
              XXIX. This satisfaction, rendered in our place by Christ, cannot be denied to be imputed to us. For who would deny that satisfaction, once rendered by a faithful debtor, could be imputed to him on whose behalf it was rendered? That same satisfaction of Christ is imputed to us by the grace of the Father, and granted, so that by it alone we may be justified in the judgment of God.
              
              XXX. That very same righteousness alone justifies, since we are freed from our guilt by that satisfaction and are fully justified. By this very satisfaction, our own and imperfect works of righteousness are not admitted into the cause of our justification; by it alone we are also fully justified. For who could deny that the debt, which we owed to God, and which, according to the writing and promissory note from which our guilt arose, bound us, having been fully paid by another, we are now freed from condemnation and the curse of the Law, and are fully justified? What other satisfaction or justification, other than that paid by Christ on our behalf, could be conceived, since besides that, no justification is given to us? No mere human atonement can stand before God, nor could it purify the conscience, nor could it prepare us as temples for God. 
              
              Colossians 2:14; Galatians 3:13. 
              
              XXXI. Indeed it is true that those to whom the satisfaction of Christ is imputed also have infused into them the habit of righteousness, which from small beginnings gradually tends toward perfection, though it will not perfectly reach it except in the life to come. But although that habit may morally make us begin to be just, it does not relate to the divine judgment. We are made just in the divine forum, in which we are freed from every accusation of sin, because sin is forgiven. And although we do not deny the habit of righteousness to those in whom it is begun (unless perhaps as a sign and indication, by which it is proven that God has already rendered grace and merciful satisfaction through Christ on our behalf), it does not on that account relate to the divine judgment, nor does it return that erroneous notion, since it has no relation to satisfaction for our sins, on account of which Christ fully satisfied. Thus, the two questions proposed at the beginning have now been resolved.
              
              XXXII. I now come to the other question. It would not be fitting for God, as Thesis 3 has shown, to impute the satisfaction of Christ to men unless, under a certain condition, those for whom satisfaction was rendered became sharers of that righteousness and those for whom satisfaction was not rendered were excluded from the benefit.
              
              XXXIII. But it was not fitting for Him to require of us the same condition which the Law demanded of us, namely perfect obedience; for that would have been both impossible and unjust. Nor was it fitting for Him to require that we should make satisfaction for our sins ourselves, either in full or in part, either in this life or in the future; for this would have been both impossible and harmful, both to God and to Christ, it being inferior to them that we should offer satisfaction for sins. For in sacrifice, and in satisfaction, or at least in its principal parts, no one else can be priest except Christ, nor can there be any other sacrifice than that which He offered on the Cross, nor is there any manner by which it could be repeated.
              
              XXXIV. Nor was it fitting that He require charity and good works as this condition. For then sanctification would be the means of justification; yet Scripture nowhere teaches this. For the reason is clear: it is not permitted by nature that the remedy should be applied before the disease. Sanctification is the remedy of corruption, that is, of sin, as physic is of physical evil, and moral healing of moral evil. And here it does not appear suitable that God should, before He purges the sins of the man to whom He has not yet forgiven sin nor granted love, expect works of sanctification, nor works pleasing to God from that man. 
              
              Psalm 51; Hebrews 9:14. 
              
              XXXV. But the goodness and wisdom of God willed to bring forth for us a condition, which above all things would be most fitting and necessary, and easy and agreeable to its nature: namely faith. For no human work could be required, since faith does not include any merit; nor would it have been equitable to impute so precious a satisfaction to one who would only be unwilling to acknowledge the benefit, since acknowledgment itself is a voluntary act of the mind.
              
              XXXVI. For what is faith other than a firm and efficacious assent to the truth of those things which have been revealed to us by God, especially the promises concerning the remission of sins and eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ? Now, since persuasion, with certain knowledge of Him in whom all our good and happiness consist, is a certain act of the intellect and a voluntary assent of the heart, it was rightly required.
              
              XXXVII. Faith thus justifies us, not as some kind of righteousness or virtue inhering in the soul, nor as a disposition of the soul by which the introduction of inherent righteousness is effected, but as the condition of the covenant of grace, which God therefore requires in place of the condition of the legal covenant (which was impossible on account of our defects), and as the acceptance of the gift of righteousness in Christ offered to us through the Gospel. And since it is given to us by the free covenant of God, so that it might be righteousness for us, it is indeed itself a habit of the soul, but not as righteousness, but as that which reveals and accepts the overflowing grace and gift of righteousness in Christ from the Gospel, and which constitutes us in that righteousness, and in that, as in a sure refuge, safely withstands the wrath to come, confidently acquiescing in it. 
              
              Romans 3:8.
              
              XXXVIII. By this condition, although nothing seems easier by nature if the nature of this part were considered, yet so great is the hardness of the human heart, so great the enmity of the mind against God, that it cannot happen that anyone should truly come to Christ unless it has been given to him by the Father, and the Word itself of the Holy Spirit shines inwardly in the soul, so that both with intellectual assent and with the full persuasion of mind we rest in Christ and with the full affection of our hearts are inclined to submit and surrender ourselves entirely to Him. Which benefit neither the Law promises, nor could it be produced by us, but it is granted only through the blessing of God, in grace and in predestination.
              
              XXXIX. From these things which have been established, it is clear that we are justified by faith, not by works. For by the works of the Law no flesh shall be justified, and indeed most emphatically so. Nor does faith justify except insofar as it rests upon and wholly embraces Christ. The Apostles constantly and directly attribute our justification not to works, but to faith alone, with no exception ever admitted or distinction of works. In the matter of justification, they consistently oppose works to faith, never works of grace to works of nature, which would have been even more fitting to propose. Why was it said, To him who believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is imputed as righteousness? (Romans 4:5). Why is faith imputed for righteousness? Why is justification described merely as remission or non-imputation of sins? Why do they so sharply contend against those who wished to join works to the Law in the matter of justification? Why is faith alone called iustitia fidei [the righteousness of faith] in that same place in which belief in Christ, that is, in Him who perfectly fulfilled the Law, is compared? Why, in the case of Abraham, is it said that faith was imputed for righteousness, when he was full of deeds of charity and good works, if faith alone, apart from works, had not been justified? Why is it said that we are justified sola fide [by faith alone], unless it is because righteousness by faith is proven and shown? Why is justification called from faith, unless it is justified (for if justification by faith were followed by another, so that death and condemnation would follow) if properly speaking, righteousness were from works? Why is justification so closely tied to life?
              
              Why everywhere do the Apostles oppose the Gospel to the Law, except when they call it crede et servaberis [believe and you will be saved]? Why is it everywhere commanded in the Gospel that we should believe? Why do they deny justification to him who trusts in his works at the dreadful tribunal of God’s righteousness, even though he may have borne so many labors, labors which are denied entry into that place of righteousness, and which must not be confessed as having satisfaction for sins, and cannot carry the weight of grace and remission of sins? (Romans 3; Galatians 2–3, 5; Ephesians 2; Galatians 3; Titus 3; Romans 10; Acts 16:31; John 3; Luke 18.)
              
              XL. Therefore good works are not necessary for our justification, in order that we, being guilty and liable to punishment, may become just—that is, in order that we may receive the abounding grace and the gift of righteousness—for these are not necessary antecedently, but they are necessary as consequences. For they are the fruits and the end of justification, from which they ought not, nor indeed can they, be torn away. For since in the new covenant God has promised to us first the remission of sins, then sanctification, and since Christ has promised to us not only justification but also sanctification, faith embraces both of these promises, and draws from the fullness of that benefit of Christ into which we are ingrafted; and that same faith produces good works as its fruits. Therefore, he who does not bring forth good works does not have true faith, but a dead corpse of faith, and although such a one pretends an external appearance of faith, he does not have its power, motion, or activity. And so, although good works declare and prove our justification, whether in the forum of our own conscience or in the last judgment, and are in fact necessary to us as arguments of the grace of God bestowed upon sinners, yet good works are necessary as arguments, as witnesses, and afterward; for faith is known by works, as a tree by its fruits, of whatever sort they are discerned to be. (a Heb. 10. 16. b 2. Cor. 1. 30. c Iac. 1.)
              
              XLI. This very matter, perhaps, will be more suitably explained in this way. Justification is opposed to accusation; now we are pressed by two accusations in the divine forum. First, it is alleged that we are sinners—that is, guilty of having violated the condition that was established by the legal covenant. Then it is alleged that we are unbelievers—that is, that we have not fulfilled the condition of the covenant of grace, namely, faith. From the former accusation we are justified by faith, by which we embrace the grace and righteousness of Christ. From the latter we are also justified by works, inasmuch as by them our faith is shown. Regarding the latter accusation James affirms that a man is justified by works, and not by faith alone. But Paul, with reference to the former, says that “by faith a man is justified without the works of the law,” adding many necessary things. (a Rom. 3. 28. b Iac. 2. 24. c Ep. ad Rom. 4. ad Gal.)
              
              XLII. In the day of judgment, since the covenant of grace obtains the force of law (for it has been promulgated throughout the whole world by fit heralds), this one thing must be proved—that we have had the condition of the covenant of grace, namely, faith. Therefore faith must be brought forward before all else, together with charity, as it were, as signs of this condition, by the effect of faith, or as an argument demonstrating it, as is commonly said, afterward.
              
              XLIII. Therefore, since the promise of righteousness, or of the remission of sins, demands from us only the condition of faith, our faith must be brought forward into that forum before any good works are demanded from us. Then we are accused, as it were, concerning our faith itself, whether it has been true in its exercise, and whether by that accusation we may be justified, not by our works, nor by our own inherent good, but by another’s good according to the ordinance of Christ; and lastly, whether through the Spirit we have advanced more and more in piety. On this account we shall be able to stand in the righteousness of judgment, which, as I have said, is the place of the covenant of grace. (d Apoc. 22. 11.)
              
              XLIV. But although it is permitted us to rely, before the heavenly Judge, upon our good works as the effects and arguments of our faith, and to repel the latter accusation on their basis, yet we are not permitted to place any trust in them as if we might satisfy the former accusation by them, whether we are unwilling or unable to do so, for the reasons we brought forward in Theses 11, 30, 31, 39. We set down the reasons: because rewards of eternal life cannot be owed by justice to merits; for they are, first, indebted; second, imperfect; third, gifts of God, for which things are to be done out of grace; fourth, they have no equality with the reward; fifth, the infinite price of the Redeemer has been paid for us; sixth, we are already instituted as heirs of eternal life not by merits, but freely; seventh, the sins of those who continually implore the mercy of God are forgiven. Add to this that whatever is attributed to human merits is so much taken away from the grace of God, who, the more sin is recognized, is all the more gloriously acknowledged. Nor does it escape our notice that some men, who wish human merits to have some share of glory, are anticipating their own perdition. (a Luc. 17. 10. b Phil. 3. 11. c 2. Cor. 8. 1–6. d 9. 15. e Rom. 8. 18. f 1. Pet. 1. 19. g Rom. 8. 17. g Rom. 6. 17, 22. h Luc. 11. 4. i Rom. 11. 6. k Rom. 3. 8. l 1. Cor. 1. 29. Dem. 9. 4; 5. 6.)
              
              XLV. By good works I mean those which God commands; for those which He does not command, however highly they may be valued among men, since they can be opposed neither to the former accusation nor to the latter, contribute nothing to our justification before God.
              
              XLVI. Since the effects of our justification are peace with God, tranquility of mind, boasting in the hope of the glory of God, even in the midst of tribulations, inseparable and glorious joy, the love of God and charity toward our neighbor, zeal for good works; and since these effects, although they follow faith and the remission of sins, nevertheless are the beginning of our progress; it is plainly fitting that we should be certain that our sins have been forgiven, and that the rights of our adoption have been restored to us in Christ Jesus. (a Rom. 5. 1. b Iac. 2. c Vers. 5. d 1. Pet. 2. e Luc. 7. 42. 47. f Col. 3. 18. g Rom. 8.)
              
              XLVII. The things we have thus far set forth come to this. 1. Since God created men capable of law, and implanted in them a conscience that might judge what is according to the law, it was necessary that there be judgment. 2. In that judgment, since there is no one whose conscience does not convict him of sin, and since God will conduct the judgment, we cannot be justified unless by grace. 3. Justice does not allow that the impious be justified without satisfaction, nor is it content with any satisfaction other than that which Christ has rendered in our place. 4. It is not just that one who willingly does not acknowledge so great a benefit, nor is able to acknowledge it sufficiently, should himself be acquitted as knowing it. Nor is it just that, with impunity proposed, license to sin should be increased, and that the impious should be justified contrary to the law, and in the future should withdraw from sin and follow sanctification, without which no one shall see the Lord.
              
              XLVIII. From this it is clear that the justification by which we, being guilty, are made just is the act of God the Father granting grace to sinners through the intervening satisfaction of Christ, and of one who truly believes in Christ. But the justification by which we are declared just is the act of Christ the Judge absolving by His own sentence, in which the Father’s having granted grace to sinners through the intervention of His satisfaction consists.
              
              This doctrine of justification, thus explained, has been arranged so that the whole glory of the divine justice, wisdom, and mercy may be illustrated, and so that the satisfaction of Christ may be celebrated, and man may be humbled in himself, but raised up in God efficaciously and gloriously to consolation; to quieting the conscience and nurturing the hope of salvation; to generating in the hearts of men the love of God and of neighbor; nor does it contribute to the gain of those who teach in the Church. Therefore it must be held as a true and saving doctrine.

              Corollaries pertaining to the doctrine of justification
              
              1. The formal object of justification is man, not insofar as he is elect, but insofar as he is believing.
             
              2. They do injury to God and to Christ who affirm that guilt is remitted while the penalty is not remitted.
             
              3. They are ridiculous who wish to make satisfaction to God, as if the satisfaction of Christ must be applied to themselves.
              
              4. Faith cannot exist without charity; yet charity does not justify.
              
              5. He who has once been justified never falls out of his justification.
