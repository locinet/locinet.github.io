# Loci Theologici
# This file defines the topic tree for tagging theological works.
#
# Rules:
# - Loci should be assigned only when a work/section includes extended discussion of that topic.
# - Loci may be added to the tree when necessary.
# - Loci may be moved around the tree without breaking anything.
# - Changing the NAME (and thus slug) of a locus requires updating all work files that reference it.
# - Slugs: lowercase, spaces to hyphens, no apostrophes or special characters.
# - desc: optional definition to disambiguate scope for AI tagging.
