        title: 'Preface. In this brief work the author aims at proving in a single argument the existence of God, and whatsoever
          we believe of God.—The difficulty of the task.—The author writes in the person of one who contemplates God, and
          seeks to understand what he believes. To this work he had given this title: Faith Seeking Understanding. He finally
          named it Proslogium,—that is, A Discourse'

        title: 'Chapter I. Exhortation of the mind to the contemplation of God.—It casts aside cares, and excludes all thoughts
          save that of God, that it may seek Him. Man was created to see God. Man by sin lost the blessedness for which he
          was made, and found the misery for which he was not made. He did not keep this good when he could keep it easily.
          Without God it is ill with us. Our labors and attempts are in vain without God. Man cannot seek God, unless God
          himself teaches him; nor find him, unless he reveals himself. God created man in his image, that he might be mindful
          of him, think of him, and love him. The believer does not seek to understand, that he may believe, but he believes
          that he may understand: for unless he believed he would not understand'

          can be conceived not to exist; in reality he cannot'

        title: Chapter VII. How he is omnipotent, although there are many things of which he is not capable.—To be capable
          of being corrupted, or of lying, is not power, but impotence. God can do nothing by virtue of impotence, and nothing
          has power against him

        title: Chapter VIII. How he is compassionate and passionless. God is compassionate, in terms of our experience, because
          we experience the effect of compassion. God is not compassionate, in terms of his own being, because he does not
          experience the feeling ( affectus ) of compassion

        title: Chapter IX. How the all-just and supremely just God spares the wicked, and justly pities the wicked. He is
          better who is good to the righteous and the wicked than he who is good to the righteous alone. Although God is supremely
          just, the source of his compassion is hidden. God is supremely compassionate, because he is supremely just. He saveth
          the just, because justice goes with them; he frees sinners by the authority of justice. God spares the wicked out
          of justice; for it is just that God, than whom none is better or more powerful, should be good even to the wicked,
          and should make the wicked good. If God ought not to pity, he pities unjustly. But this it is impious to suppose.
          Therefore, God justly pities

          because he does not inflict the punishment deserved

          which is every good, and wholly good, and the only good.—Since the Word is true, and is truth itself, there is nothing
          in the Father, who utters it, which is not accomplished in the Word by which he expresses himself. Neither is the
          love which proceeds from Father and Son unequal to the Father or the Son, for Father and Son love themselves and
          one another in the same degree in which what they are is good. Of supreme simplicity nothing can be born, and from
          it nothing can proceed, except that which is this, of which it is born, or from which it proceeds
