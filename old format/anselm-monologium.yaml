        title: Preface. In this book Anselm discusses, under the form of a meditation, the Being of God, basing his argument
          not on the authority of Scripture, but on the force of reason. It contains nothing that is inconsistent with the
          writings of the Holy Fathers, and especially nothing that is inconsistent with those of St. Augustine . —The Greek
          terminology is employed in Chapter LXXVIII., where it is stated that the Trinity may be said to consist of three
          substances, that is, three persons
